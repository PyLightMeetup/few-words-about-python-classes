    "Python has great built-in data structures, like dictionaries, lists, sets and tuples, however sometimes it's hard to represent problem that we're trying to solve with only those basic structures and that's when classes come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are they ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be defined as logical bundling of data and functionality together. What that means is that classes can consist of any data and methods, however very often we want those data and methods to be connected with each other, e.g. it's common to create classes to represent real-world concepts, like `ShoppingCart`, `Customer` or `Address`, or to represent parts of our application e.g. `HTTPClient`. Thanks to classes, we can much easier write code that is structured, modular and easier to comprehend.\n",
